# News Bias Detector

A program to test for biased language and subjectivity, with focus on partisan vocabulary in news text snippets.

## Dependencies

Install nltk, spaCy, and vaderSentiment in order for svo-senti.py to work:
```
sudo pip install -U nltk
sudo pip install -U spacy
sudo python -m spacy download en
sudo pip install vaderSentiment
```

Install NumPy, TensorFlow, and Keras in order for classify.py to work:  
First follow instructions from TensorFlow [installation guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) to get TensorFlow on machine with CPU/GPU support as preferred.
```
pip install numpy
pip install keras
```

## Run

In terminal command line, use as follows:
```
python detect_bias.py "[block of text]"
python svo-senti.py "[block of text]"
python classify.py"
```
svo-senti.py preprocesses and populates a data.csv file containing sentences to classify, one per row, which can then be used by classify.py.

## Examples

```
$ python detect_bias.py "Grenfell disaster victims murdered by political decisions"

$ python detect_bias.py "If Republican efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare 
are successful, one of the biggest winners would be the wealthy. The Senate's 
bill -- released this week -- differs in key ways from the House-passed version. 
But proposals eliminate the taxes imposed on high-income Americans to help 
pay for an expansion of health benefits under the Affordable Care Act. The 
legislation also would let people contribute more to certain tax-advantaged accounts."
