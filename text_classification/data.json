	"reliable": ["The short answer is Bush wanted   indeed needed   to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq   At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9  11 attacks on the U  S Though he never gave up on that stratagem the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people already fixated on Afghanistan to support a war against Baghdad But the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful   not because there was any hard evidence for the charge   but because supposedly reliable witnesses   in the persons of exiled anti  Saddam Iraqis   many on the U  S   government  s payroll      kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true What we had was a U  S   leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq   and informants who   in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam   were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons   The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof    Likewise   the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U  S   campaign generating both fear and war fever So the U  S   and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program   as well as chemical and biological weapons     That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand", "Videos 15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations     Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt   Brian Ferguson  U  S   Air Force The Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month    the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital   MSF   last October The US claimed it had conducted a   counter  terrorism   strike against Islamic State   IS   fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28   But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elder  s return from a pilgrimage to Mecca"]
